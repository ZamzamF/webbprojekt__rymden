    <h2>FACTS</h2>
    <h3>Pluto is one third water</h3> 
     <p>This is in the form of water ice which is more than 3 times as much
        water as in all the Earth’s oceans, the remaining two thirds are rock.
        Pluto’s surface is covered with ices, and has several mountain ranges,
        light and dark regions, and a scattering on craters.</p> 
  
    <h3>Pluto has been visited by one spacecraft</h3>
    <p>The New Horizons spacecraft, which was launched in 2006, flew by 
        Pluto on the 14th of July 2015 and took a series of images and other 
        measurements. New Horizons is now on its way to the Kuiper Belt to 
        explore even more distant objects.</p>

    <h3>Pluto is the largest dwarf planet</h3>
    <p>At one point it was thought this could be Eris. Currently the most 
       accurate measurements give Eris an average diameter of 2,326 km with 
       a margin of error of 12 km, while Pluto’s diameter is 2,372 km with a 2 
        km margin of error.</p>
